	<h1>Image Segmentation</h1>
	</center>

	<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>
	The assignment is to use various techniques to segment pictures of cells 
	into binary images and perform analysis on them to find out their size, 
	orientation, and circularity.
	</p>

	<p>
	This is useful for automating cell detection and classification which is 
	currently a tediously time consuming process for biomedical applications.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Compiling and Running</h2>

	<h3>Compiling</h3>
	<p>
	This program was written and compiled on csa3 using g++.

	On the command line, type in <br>
	<span style="background: #000; color: #FFF;"> 
		<tt> $ make </tt>
	</span>
	<br>

	<h2>Algorithm Design</h2>
	<hr>
	<h3>Segmentation</h3>

	<br>
	<img src="img/segment.gif">

	<p>
	The segmentation algorithm chosen was peakiness detection, because its  
	flexibility and relative ease of implementation. It performed rather well
	but only after some tweaks, listed below. 
	</p>

	<p>
	First, a range of minimum distances between highest and second highest 
	pixels was used (2 to 32) and the highest peakiness was chosen from there.
	This range was chosen after trial and error experimentation.
	<br>
	Also, to remove the numerical labels assigned to the cells as well as the 
	halos surrounding the cells, a normalization filter was applied to the 
	images, which blended in any pixels that were within a close brightness
	value to the highest and lowest brightness values in the image.
	</p>

	<p>
	After finding the maximum peakiness, the stored brightness value yielding
	that max was used as the threshold.
	</p>

	<h3>Area</h3>
	<br>
	<img src="img/area.gif">

	<p>
	Area was simple to calculate; after obtaining a binary image, the number of
	black pixels was counted up and output as the area.
	</p>

	<h3>Orientation</h3>
	<br>
	<img src="img/orientation.gif">

	<p>
	The orientation of the cell was calculated as the angle counter-clockwise 
	with respect to the y axis of the cell, in degrees. 
	</p>

	<h3>Circularity</h3>
	<br>
	<img src="img/circularity.gif">

	<p>
	The circularity algorithm selected was the ratio of Axis of Least Inertia
	to Axis of Most Inertia.
	</p>

	<h3>Labeling</h3>
	<p>
	The labeling algorithm goes through the binary image and marks each
	unmarked black pixel with a different color and recurses on its 8 neighbors 
	until no more neighbors remain. Then it loops to the next unmarked pixel,
	repeating until no more unmarked black pixels remain.
	</p>

	<h3>Blur</h3>
	<p>
	A slight blurring was implemented to even out cell pixel brightness vs 
	background pixel brightness in an attempt to create a good threshold that 
	separates them cleanly. 
	</p>	

	The blur mask used was <br>
	<img src="img/blur.gif" style="border: none">
	<br>

	<h3>Region Merging</h3>
	<p>
	No region merging algorithm was used due to lack of time; however, a 
	function was implemented that removed any pixel group with an area less 
	than 100 pixels. This helped eliminate any remaining noise that the blur 
	and the threshold missed.
	</p>

	<h3>Two Celled Images</h3>
	<p>
	For any images with two cells, I chose to split the image in half and 
	analyze each half separately, then combine the output. This gives a much 
	more accurate analysis when using peakiness segmentation since each cell
	gets a different threshold, helping accentuate its differences from the 
	ambient background.
	</p>


	<h2>Results and Conclusion</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>
	Overall, the system worked fairly well on the images with a clear and 
	distinct brightness difference between the cells and the background, 
	because it was highly dependent on the peakiness algorithm to segment the
	image successfully; if the segmentation was not clean, the other algorithms
	would have much higher rates of error. 
	</p>

	<p>
	As a result, the first three images yielded a respectable binary
	representation of the cells in the picture. However, the fourth image did
	not yield a threshold that separated the cells from the background. Only
	the small dark particles within each cell's nucleus were detected, and
	those were removed from the image by the "region merging" 
	algorithm. The cells are virtually transparent; using an edge detection 
	modified for segmentation would have been a better approach for them.
	</p>

	<h3>Error</h3>
	<br>
	The percent error for the results obtained are as follows:
	<br>
	<img src="img/error.gif">

	<p>
	The area calculations suffered from the peakiness algorithm not correctly 
	segmenting the pictures into binary images. However, by obtaining the
	general shape of the cells, the peakiness segmentation algorithm was able 
	to still generate the approximate shape of the cell, leading to a much 
	better calculation of the orientation.
	</p>

	<p>
	No error analysis could be performed on the circularity since no ground 
	truth was given, but the values seem consistent since none of the detected
	cells have a particularly round shape.
	</p>

	<h3>Possible Improvements</h3>
	<p>
	Implementing these algorithms was not difficult, but my lack of modularity 
	in the beginning was an expensive mistake to make because it made debugging 
	more difficult than necessary. Splitting up each algorithm into a function 
	made the implementation much more modular and easier to handle, which is 
	what I should have done to start off with.
	</p>

	<p>
	The peakiness segmentation algorithm was too simplistic to cleanly handle 
	the cell pictures; an edge detection algorithm modified for segmentation 
	would have been a better idea, especially since there was great difficulty
	in adjusting the peakiness algorithm to ignore the numbers and the white 
	halos surrounding the cells. I wish we were given the algorithm for the 
	Canny edge detection algorithm; it looked to be very effective, although 
	quite complex.
	</p>

	<p>
	An edge detection segmenter would have also stood a better chance against 
	the fourth image, since those cells are outlined but have the same
	brightness as the background.
	</p>

	<p>
	Using an actual region merging algorithm instead of speck removal would not 
	have been particularly helpful since the peakiness results did not yield 
	large chunks of separate components, but instead just one large component 
	and small specks throughout the image where the threshold failed to segment
	correctly.
	</p>

	<p>
	More adjustments on the type of blur and the amount used might have smoothed
	out some of the images to obtain a less speckled binary image after running 
	the peakiness segmenter.
